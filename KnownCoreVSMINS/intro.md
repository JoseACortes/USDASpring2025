I want to make a full simulation comparing core harvesting methods and and carbon mapping using MINS

Goals:

- Generate 3d function from previous data
    - Verify the function works returns the core 
- Use function to make mcnp simulation
- Mins simulation
    - Simulate MINS calibration
    - Simulate MINS around field
- Deconvolude Spectra
- Compare error to function

Future work:

- Doing so with a
